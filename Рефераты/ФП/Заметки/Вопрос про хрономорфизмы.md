## Q
Suppose we have functions like this:
```scala
def futu  [F[_]: Functor, X]: (X => Free[F, X]  ) => X => Fix[F]
def histo [F[_]: Functor, X]: (Cofree[F, X] => X) => Fix[F] => X
def dynamo[F[_]: Functor, A, B]: (A => F[A], Cofree[F, B] => B) => A => B =  
  (coalg, alg) => ana(coalg) andThen histo(alg)
```

Hi everyone. I'm learning recursion patterns, but I can't figure out the usefulness of futumorphism and histomorphism.

The couple of Scala examples I found look very unconvincing. I also found Haskell examples, but I can't figure them out.

Can anyone give some good Scala examples of using
- futumorphism (prime numbers, maybe)?
- dynamomorphism (histomorphism within) applied to a typical dynamic programming problem?

And where exactly is the reference to "past" and "future" values ​​there?

## Comment 1

Dynamic programming is popular now, and `dynamo` is positioned as a suitable tool for such tasks. I want to believe that these are not empty words.))) I found [such an example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46525571/an-example-for-chronomorphism/46698107#46698107) but I don't know Haskell well((

Perhaps there are useful Haskell examples with `futu`, but this will also require translation to Scala...

And I want to better understand why these morphisms have such names.
