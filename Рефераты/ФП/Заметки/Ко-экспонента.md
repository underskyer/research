**Proposition.** (Crolard 2001) The co-exponent $B_A$ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is defined iff $A = ∅$ or $B = ∅$.
**Proof:** The co-exponent of $A$ and $B$ is an object $B_A$ together with an arrow $e_{A,B}: B → B_A ⊕ A$ such that for any arrow $f : B → C ⊕ B$ there exists a unique $f^∗ : B_A → C$ making the following diagram commute:

If $A \neq ∅ \neq B$ then the functions $f$ and $e_{A,B}$ for every $b ∈ B$ must choose a side, left or right, of the coproduct in their target and moreover. Hence, if we take a nonempty set $C$ and $f$ with the property that for some $b$ different sides are chosen by $f$ and $e_{A,B}$, then the diagram does not commute.

Implication can be described as the right adjoint to conjunction. This means that $Hom(A∧B,C)$ is naturally isomorphic to $Hom(A,B→C)$. We can dualise this definiton to obtain the correct definition of a co-implication, usually called **subtraction**.

Subtraction is a left adjoint to disjunction. That is, $Hom(A\backslash B,C)$ is isomorphic to $Hom(B,C∨A)$. But what does this really mean? An easy way to understand it is to look at classical logic. There, you can easily verify that $A\backslash B$ simply means $¬A∧B$, similarly to how implication reduces to $¬A∨B$. Subtraction really means **but**.
