> Here are some relevant papers from a quick search:

- King and Wadler 1992: [Combining Monads](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-3215-8_12) Seems to be a first work investigating this topic in functional programming
    
- Jones and Duponcheel 1993: [Composing Monads](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/RR-1004.pdf) Appears fairly accessible, detailed presentation of several conditions for monad composition. Extract from the abstract:
    

> In practice, it is usually possible to construct a monad that supports some specific combination of features. However, the techniques used are typically ad-hoc and it is very difficult to find general techniques for combining arbitrary monads. This report gives three general constructions for the composition of monads, each of which depends on the existence of an auxiliary function linking the monad structures of the components. In each case, we establish a set of laws that the auxiliary function must satisfy to ensure that the composition is itself a monad.

- Summary on page 12 of the previous paper, which may be especially interesting (don't know how to format better):
    

> At first glance, the constructions in the previous sections may seem rather mysterious; in each case, we gave a type for some polymorphic function, stated some laws that it should satisfy . . . and ‘presto!’ we have another way of composing monads. In fact, these constructions were discovered largely by experimentation...

- McBride and Paterson 2005: [Applicative Programming with Effects](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf) The big applicative paper has on page 9 a brief discussion of composition with some intuition. They cite Barr and Wells 1984, which is a work in category theory.
    

> As a consequence, the composition of two monads may not be a monad, but it is certainly applicative. For example, both Maybe ◦ IO and IO ◦ Maybe are applicative: IO◦Maybe is an applicative functor in which computations have a notion of ‘failure’ and ‘prioritised choice’, even if their ‘real world’ side-effects cannot be undone. Note that IO and Maybe may also be composed as monads (though not vice versa), but the applicative functor determined by the composed monad differs from the composed applicative functor: the binding power of the monad allows the second IO action to be aborted if the first returns a failure.

If anyone has more links to point to or another good explanation for monad composition, please let us know!

I really hope there is a profound explanation for this situation, so that the boundary between applicatives and monads become crystal clear, and so that monads make even more sense
