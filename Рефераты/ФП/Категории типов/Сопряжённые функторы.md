Many other patterns of recursion exist that are equally well-defined, but they cannot be expressed directly in terms of catamorphisms. However, most recursion schemes are adjoint folds (Hinze, Wu and Gibbons, 2013 (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/recursion+scheme#HinzeWG13)), i.e. every complex recursion scheme can be reduced to a basic one via an adjunction. Moreover, every recursion scheme is an instance of a conjugate hylomorphism (Hinze, Wu and Gibbons, 2015 (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/recursion+scheme#HinzeWG15)) .

>To be distributable a container will need to have a way to consistently zip a potentially infinite number of copies of itself. This effectively means that the holes in all values of that type, must have the same cardinality, fixed sized vectors, infinite streams, functions, etc. and no extra information to try to merge together.
